#MedLink
#About
A supply order and tracker app made for specifications of the Peace Corps Med Link team. This app allows PC volunteers living in extremely low bandwidth environments across the world, quickly and easily order and track non-prescription medical supplies they need for their stay.

#How it works 
The volunteers are easily able to see the list of supplies they have requested and monitor the status of the supply on the home screen after login. The volunteers are then able to request supplies they need by choosing from the listed supplies and also send special instructions if need be, they also have the ability to send the request via text message if there is a complete loss of network. On the responses page the volunteers have the option of selecting the received supplies or flag necessary supplies they have been waiting on for a long time.

#Features

•	HMAC Signer – for a secure data transfer

•	Push Notifications
